#### What makes Spotter Tracker different?

- Dead simple, one button interface.
- With one click you can save your current location or start recording a track.
- Easily copy the coordinates of your spot's to the clipboard for immediate use.
- Easily export spots or tracks to geojson.
- As soon as coordinates are received, they're saved to your phone--if your phone's battery dies mid-recording, you don't lose any data!
